Version 1: Website developed using newest features of CDD Grid.

Version 2: After developing the whole website it will be refactored to mobile first version with
feature query which will add grid properties for browsers who support it.

Goal of the project is to learn how to slice PSD web-design files and use them as a basis for 
web development.
